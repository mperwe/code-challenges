##Local Storage vs. Session Storage:##

#Local Storage:# Data stored here persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.
#Session Storage:# Data stored here is cleared when the page session ends (i.e., when the page is closed).

##JavaScript Functions:##

#1. saveLocalStorage():# Saves the user's input to Local Storage.
#2. loadLocalStorage():# Loads the data from Local Storage and displays it.
#3. saveSessionStorage():# Saves the user's input to Session Storage.
#4. loadSessionStorage():# Loads the data from Session Storage and displays it.

The code demonstrates a simple way to use web storage APIs to persist data on the client's browser.
